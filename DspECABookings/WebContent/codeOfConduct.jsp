<h1>CODE OF CONDUCT FOR EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</h1>

The code of conduct followed in school should be continued into after school activities to ensure that all children can enjoy ECAs without disruption and upset.

Please remind your child/children of the Code before they start back to extra curricular classes next term:

<ul>
<li>Full co-operation, courtesy and respect for the teacher, other children and equipment is required from everyone</li>
<li>Children should always speak to each other and the adults involved in a polite fashion. Personal remarks – remarks about another person’s family, personal habits, clothes or belongings, for example - can be harmful. In the same way as they have no place at school, they have no place at after school activities</li>
<li>Participants must obey the instructions of the activity teacher and helpers</li>
</ul>
The following offences are not tolerated:
