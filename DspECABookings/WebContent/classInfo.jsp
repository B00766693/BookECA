<h1>CLASS INFORMATION AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

<h3>How do I book ECAs this term?</h3>
On the home page, complete the questions listed underneath the Calendar: your child’s name, their class, your name and contact numbers. Agree to the Code
of Conduct by clicking the checkbox - a copy of Code of Conduct is available on the link above and from the main page. <br>
To select the activities/classes tick the checkboxes in the table  .<br>
Then Click the green submit button (below the table) to confirm your selection.<br>
With this system there is one booking transaction per child, one child = 1 submission/payment, multiple children can’t go on same form. Choose
the activities you wish to book for each child, then pay for each child (see next question).

<h3>How should I Pay?</h3>
Please transfer money due to the PTA account - details listed on the booking confirmation page.
If you require financial assistance or have any other specific queries about payment please contact
the ECA Administrators.


<h3>What if my child can’t attend his/her ECA?</h3>
If your child cannot attend their ECA for any reason, please leave a message with the school as
unexplained absences can place undue strain on the ECA Instructors and ECA Supervisors.
Should a parent be late, any child awaiting collection should return to the school office and alert
Alice, Gillian or Debbie who will contact the parent and arrange supervision for the child until pick up.
What happens if an ECA is cancelled?


<h3>Will my Child(ren) get into his/her chosen ECA?</h3>
Places on all ECAs are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Due to the small class sizes in
Arts & Crafts and DSP Writing Club early registration via the on-line booking link is advisable.

<h3>My child is in JI/SI – are there any activities that start at 1.10?</h3>
Unfortunately it is not possible to offer activities for Junior/Senior Infants between the end of school at
1.10 and the start of ECAs at 2.10.

<h3>Who takes the Classes?</h3>

<font color=green>Arts & Crafts: </font>Stella Kearns runs Arts & Craft ECA on Tuesdays.

<font color=green>Hockey:</font> Cara Kelehan organises the Hockey ECA and will be taking all children from 1st – 6th
class on a Friday. Open for 1st  - 6th class children. This will take place on the new hockey pitch at Rathdown School as per last
year. Cara will meet students in a designated classroom for roll call and will walk the group
across to Rathdown via the DSP back gate and return to DSP for collection at 3:45. Places are limited to 45.

Thursdays. Children should be ready on the pool deck at 3.00pm. Students are assessed by
the swimming instructors and assigned places accordingly. Swimming is open to all classes.

We hope the children enjoy their activities. If you have any queries or suggestions, please
feel free to drop a note for the attention of the ECA coordinator into the PTA box beside the
school office.<br><br>

The ECAs operate on a ‘not for profit’ basis. Any excess revenue is held by the PTA
and contributes to the range of activities (yoga, playball and other in-class activities)
funded by the PTA throughout the year.
